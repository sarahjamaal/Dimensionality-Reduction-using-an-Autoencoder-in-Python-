# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-an-Autoencoder-in-Python-
## Overview
 (<--   )This Repo that creates a dummy dataset of high dimensionality, and reduce its dimensionality using PCA.
(<--   ) using autoencoder and how it is essentially a nuanced neural network.
Designing, training, and evaluating an encoder from a trained autoencoder with scikit-learn.
in this project i use scikit-learn's Neural Network module to design, 
train, and evaluate an autoencoder using high dimensional data. Using this autoencoder
to extract its encoder half for dimensionality reduction.
