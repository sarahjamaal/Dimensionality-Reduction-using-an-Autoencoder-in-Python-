# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-an-Autoencoder-in-Python-
## Overview
This Repo that creates a dummy dataset of high dimensionality, and reduce its dimensionality using PCA.\
- Using autoencoder and how it is essentially a nuanced neural network.\
- Designing, training, and evaluating an encoder from a trained autoencoder with scikit-learn.\
- In this project i use scikit-learn's Neural Network module to design, 
train, and evaluate an autoencoder using high dimensional data.\
Using this autoencoderto extract its encoder half for dimensionality reduction.
